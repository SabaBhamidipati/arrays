#### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

*Arrays are a very deep part of Ruby from what I recall. Therefore, I feel like I'm only scratching the surface here. And I need a TON of practice regardless!*

#### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*I have struggled with Hashes and Arrays in the past. Although, Hashes are definitely far more difficult than Arrays! I can't think of any additional learning besides a lot of practice*


#### What questions do you have about Arrays?
*Right now, based on the work I've submitted, it's clear I can't remember how to run Ruby files! So I'm hoping there will be some help on that in the next section*
